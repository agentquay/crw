                <h2>FAQ’s </h2>

                <h3>Who exactly do you do? </h3>
                <p>Marketing and Creative Agencies contract with me to assist them on projects it because of staffing limitations or knowledge base. These contracts can be long term and ongoing or short term for a one-time project. Most often this is for media planning and buying, client pitches, market research and strategy. </p>
                <p>Small businesses contract with me to assist them with getting their marketing started or on track. Generally this is for strategy and planning to start with and then executing projects over time.</p>

                <h3>I’m a Small Business Owner and never worked with a Consultant before. Can you really help me with my specific marketing/advertising needs?</h3>
                <p>I hope so! Before we do any work together (and you are billed for anything) we will have a couple of conversations about your past marketing, current needs and what your goals are for the future. You will also be asked to complete a detailed questionnaire, which will allow me to learn even more about your business and specific needs. This is a great check for both of us to make sure that I’m the right fit and can give you valuable help you are looking for. </p>

                <h3>What can I expect this to cost?</h3>
                <p>It all varies so much based on your particular project and needs. Is this a one-time project? Do you need ongoing assistance with your marketing & advertising needs? It is best to contact me so we can discuss your specific needs and create a customized quote.</p>

                <h3>What are your payment terms? When will I be billed?</h3>
                <p>Your Client Service Agreement will discuss the payment terms. I will let you know exactly when you will be invoiced. Typically, projects priced at $250 and under are billed in full, and amounts above this are billed in two increments, with a 50% deposit due at the time of contract signing. </p>
                <p>For consultation, I invoice once we schedule an official meeting time, and request that you submit payment before we meet.</p>

                <h3>Are you available to help me if I have additional questions after my project is completed?</h3>
                <p>For the most part, yes! I’m happy to answer any quick follow up questions you might have, and I’ll provide you with recap that will hopefully answer your questions too. If you require additional help that might need more than just a few quick emails, we can discuss setting up consultation.</p>
